# Covid-19-Spread-Simulation
This is a COVID-19 spread Simulation under lockdown conditions where people have a higher probabilty of visiting their nearest landmarks (Shops, Mosque, other gathering places etc) and undergo an infection probability function if they end up visiting the same landmark as a covid positive person within the same hour. 

The infection probability function uses the death probabilty grouped by age groups of Newyork published March 2020 and was mapped onto a 1000x1000 grid with 2000 initial population and 10 landmarks/stores due to limited computational resources, however it can easily be scaled if anyone wishes to.
